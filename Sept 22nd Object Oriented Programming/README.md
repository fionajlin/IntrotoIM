## Object-Oriented Programming

### Week 3 | Fiona Lin | due September 22nd

This week, our assignment focused on making art through object-oriented programming. Although I was initially quite confused, I learned that this term refers to a method of programming that uses classes to define a template for objects. In other words, the core of the method revolves around the concept of objects, and the ways in which traits or properties can be grouped to form a particular type of object.

In thinking about my artwork for this week, I was particularly intrigued by the concept of "generative art" that we discussed in class. I really liked the idea that "art" in this kind of generative system is pretty much only defined by personal preference, and that through running the program countless times, the artist could simply choose whichever iterations that struck their fancy. I actually thought this kind of process was more interesting for static artwork than attempting to capture something that is constantly moving around. I found it convenient that while generative art allows for an aspect of randomization that can surprise the artist, the static nature of it allowed the artist to also take time to contemplate and capture each iteration, rather than scramble to save something that changes constantly. As such, for my art piece, I chose to make a code that randomizes but remains static in each instance that it is run. 

I knew from the get-go that I wanted to make something that utilizes a large number of objects that vary in size, as that allows for more instances of randomization and allows the viewer to witness a larger number of possibilities in each instance where the program is run. In order to do this, I understood that I needed to use both classes and arrays in order to achieve the best results, and as I was still a little unfamiliar with these methods, I chose to base my project off of the in-class example that we discussed. 

I consulted the class example quite a bit for understanding the structure for making classes, and also rewatched the [Dan Shiffman tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcbcfkLzgvs&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bb7z2IJaTlzwzIg_5yvL4i&index=1) that were previously assigned. Furthermore, I used the class example as well as the [Processing reference page](https://processing.org/reference/Array.html) to better understand arrays, as at the point of beginning this assignment I was still a little confused as to how exactly an array functioned. 

After I created my first code that made a series of rectangles with varying sizes, positions, and colors, however, I found the art to be a little boring overall.

Although I did like how the art turned out, I felt that it was a little too simple, and that it didn't seem like something that would be interesting to look at over time. As such, I chose to add another layer to the art by incorporating a class of ellipses. In order to make the ellipses stand out, however, I chose to have them in greyscale as opposed to the rainbow-colored rectangles, and also to modify the opacity of the rectangles to really create a "layered" appearance. Furthermore, I wanted something to break up the shapes from each other, so I added a colored, thicker outline to the ellipses to juxtapose against the greyscale, thinner outlines on the rectangles. This resulted in these iterations of artwork:

While I was working on my code, I found that at times, it was a bit difficult to keep track of exactly what each section of the code was doing, and that I easily got lost in what I was working on when I went to consult other examples or sources because I had quite a few lines of very similar-looking code. In order to organize my program and help myself keep track of every aspect, I tried to add comments to each section, even if they were as simple as just a heading or brief explanation, just so there was a way for me to quickly orient myself. 

Overall, I found this project to be really fun, not only because I was able to run through many different instances of my code and find something new or intresting  every time, but also because it helped me better understand the functions of classes and arrays, which I trust will be useful in the future as well.
