## Artwork with Loops

### Week 2 | Fiona Lin | due September 14th 

My poject this week is a piece of artwork that uses random functions for coloring, but unfortunately it seems the video file doesn't load properly so I've attached a still image here instead. The video version of the piece can be found [here](https://github.com/fionajlin/IntrotoIM/blob/main/Sept%2014th%20Loop%20Artwork/media/video%20loop%20art.mov)

Beginning this project was a little difficult to me, as I didn't really have an image or design in mind for the type of art that I wanted to create. I read over the assignment brief several times, and in the end decided to focus less on how the work appeared and more on just getting used to coding the loops involved. 

For this assignment, I mainly played around with the basic shapes that we worked with previously but tried new ways of coding them beyond just inputting coordinate values. In particular, I was interested in defining my own functions in order to make organizing my code a little easier, as I could then write a couple of lines for circles and group them all under a drawcircle () and run that function so that each circle-esque element is created together. 

I started out with just a black background and several lines of shapes in white, but I later decided that was a little too boring so I chose to bring in colors instead. Furthermore, I wanted to have several different shapes in the art to create a bit of variation, and also look at how the shapes affect each other in a loop. I wanted the piece to have a small dynamic element, so chose to add colors using the random () function, and also wanted to test out different opacities, so I chose to make that aspect a random function as well. 

Furthermore, for some of my shapes I chose to limit the opacity by reducing the upper limit of the values assigned through random, which produced paler and more muted iterations of the filled shapes. I also added several shapes without fill as a contrast against the rest of the elements. 

When coding this piece, one of the main difficulties that I ran into was that it was difficult for me to figure out the values to assign to my variables, as well as the increases in the functions used. At times, when I attempted to move things around to tidy up the piece, the shapes would move too much or get distorted, so I ended up with artwork that doesn't seem as cohesive as I wish it was. Upon reflecting on this, however, I figured that I would approach this assignment in a way that is less so about the "art" and more about the practice itself, especially because it's difficult to assign my subjective understanding of "perfection" or "completion" to a piece that is made to be constantly changing. 

Overall, I thought this process was more difficult than what we did last week with the Self-Portraits, but I found it rewarding all the same. I found it imteresting how the final product almost seemed like an optical illusion in that the longer I stared at it, the faster the shapes seemed to move despite having a set framerate of 5. Athough this aspect was unexpected, I liked how it came out, as it seemed to add an extra layer of interaction with the work of art.
