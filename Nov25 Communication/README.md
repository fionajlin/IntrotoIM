For this week's projects, we worked on getting Arduino and Processing to communicate with each other, and using serial information from Arduino to control elements within Processing.

The main issue I had was that at one point, my Processing seemed to stop working. When I clicked RUN, nothing would happen, and when I tried to save the code, 
the saving notice would pop up at the bottom, but not complete no matter how long I left it for. I tested it in several different files before eventually just
copying my code into a github page temporarily and closing down Processing so I could restart the program. Once I did that, everything worked as intended, so perhaps it was just a temporary software issue.
