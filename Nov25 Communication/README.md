For this week's projects, we worked on getting Arduino and Processing to communicate with each other, and using serial information from Arduino to control elements within Processing.

The main issue I had was that at one point, my Processing seemed to stop working. When I clicked RUN, nothing would happen, and there would be random long strings of text printed in the bottom window but no error message. I initially thought it was an error with my code, so I checked it over again and found a place where I mistyped a name, but when I tried to run it again, nothing happened at all. I then thought it might be because the file wasn't saved, so I tried to do that, but 
the saving notice would pop up at the bottom, but not complete no matter how long I left it for. I tested it in several different files before eventually just
copying my code into a github page temporarily and closing down Processing so I could restart the program. Once I did that and pasted my code back in, everything worked as intended, so perhaps it was just a temporary software issue.
