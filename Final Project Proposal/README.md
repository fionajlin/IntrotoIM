For my final project, I'd like to make a mini-game that draws upon the concept of rock, paper, scissors or just guessing games. To be specific, it's a game between one player and the computer, where the player tries to guess the color that the computer will pick. 

I want to use the ultrasonic sensor to detect when players get close enough, which will then prompt the processing window to display a start screen. Then, I want the player to use colored buttons to place a bet on the color that the computer will pick, after which both colors will be displayed side by side through processing.

If the colors are the same, the game will show a winning screen and a green LED will light up. If not, it'll show a replay screen and a red LED will light up. The game can then be restarted with a key on the laptop. 


Another similar idea is that processing will generate a prompt color word, and the player can use the buttons to add rgb values in order to make that color. In essence it's guessing how to create the color prompted.
