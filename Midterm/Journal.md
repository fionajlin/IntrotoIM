- choose your own adventure game
- multiple endings: maybe 5 total? 
- only one ending is the good ending --> every time you reach a bad ending, you restart the game
- main character: some kind of simple shape? maybe just a circle?
- split screen mode = half of the screen indicates one choice while the other half indicates another choice?
  - or should i use little boxes to indicate each choice? --> look into coding limited clicking space
  - or use keyPressed so that the choices are consistently left or right! (this seems like the most efficient way)  
     - using keys "F" and "J" might be good - have underlines for typing purposes = easily understandable?
- every time a choice is made, redirect to another screen --> add background photo to indicate change?
- simple story otherwise the layers might get too complicated


Story plotting: (in order to proceed - hit spacebar)

[title screen] circles and squares: a simple love story

[exposition] (might be good to add some kind of effect? how do i achieve a typing effect?)
- circle has had a major crush on square for a long time. today is the day he has to confess!

[good ending] circle manages to meet square alone and gets the courage to confess - happy ever after

[bad ending 1] circle gets square alone but is interrupted because he hesitated

[bad ending 2] circle gets lost in the school and fails to meet square

[bad ending 3] circle gets delayed by a friend and fails to meet square

[bad ending 4] circle is talked out of confessing by his friend and decides to keep pining


NOTE FOR CODE: need to redraw every frame --> use background function every time at the start and then redraw everything that stays constant
