## Making a Game: Choose Your Own Adventure

### Midterm | Fiona Lin | due October 14th

When I first saw the prompt for our midterm project and understood that we had to design a game, I wanted to find a way to combine skills that I am already familiar with with the content that we're learning in Intro to IM. I initially thought about games that I personally enjoy, but those seemed a bit too difficult for me to code in practicality, so I chose to make another style of game that I really liked in childhood: the visual novel. 

In order to make the game interactive, I tried to integrate a variety of different routes that the story could take so that there's more chances for the player to make choices, but I also didn't want to overcomplicate things, so I settled on five endings in total. To account for the restart function, I decided to make it so that the game only has one "true" ending (or a happy ending) and every other ending would be a "false" ending, or essentially a failed route, so that the player was encouraged to replay the game until they reach the happy end. 

I decided to go with a rather simple story involving crushes and confessions. I felt like confessing to your crush was one of the situations where things could go wrong in a lot of different ways, so I thought it would be easy and fun to explore. I was also somewhat reminded of this topic when I recalled one of our previous class discussions, in which we were asked about instances where communication with our crushes didn't go as we hoped, which further cemented my idea.

For the style of the game, I wanted to go with a very minimalistic appearance. I decided to make the game with a black background and white text, and set the characters as a variety of simple shapes as a general illustration of what was going on. My game is primarily text-based, so I didn't want to have the images used draw too much attention away from the actual story. Finally, I decided to add in the sound effect of a page flipping so that the game evokes the sense of a storybook being read through. 

In coding my project, I had the most difficulty with getting my game to change scenes properly. The main issue that I ran into was that the program would skip over any pages in the middle and head straight to the last page whenever I pressed my keys. After consulting the professor about this, I figured out that I needed to include state variables to make sure my program was keeping track and capable of differentiating between pages, and also alter my function to keyReleased() as opposed to keyPressed(). I realized that I had misunderstood that the keyPressed() only called the function once and overlooked the factor of the duration of press, which may cause the function to run several times. Lastly, I also had to modify my "if" statement so that each instance was an "else" if" rather than just an independent "if" statement. 

Once I made these changes, I got the program to progress properly from page to page. From then on, I just went through and hashed out the details of the text and shape positioning, and making sure everything was relatively clear and easy to understand. 

I also had one minor difficulty with the addition of sound effects. After I coded my sound and added the .wav file to the data folder, I still couldn't manage to hear the sound when I ran the program. When I tested it again a bit later, the sound was playing perfectly through my earbuds. The only difference was that the first time I ran the code I didn't have any earbuds connected, so I wonder if it's some kind of system setting for my laptop that I need to change instead. However, I believe that since the sound plays fine through my earbuds, the code probably is working correctly as well.

Overall, I thought this midterm project was rather challenging in the ways in which it asked us to apply all of the knowledge and skills that we've accumulated through the first half of the semester. Even so, I thought it was a really fun process because I got to utilize my creativity and also test different ways in which I can code things so that it runs smoothly and exactly like I envisioned. I enjoyed the project a lot, and I think from it I also gained a lot of new respect for game developers, as I now understand how difficult and complicated it can be to code even a simple game, much less an exponentially longer and more visually compelling game with a variety of other functions to take into account. 

For this project, I mainly took resources from the Processing reference pages on [keyPressed()](https://processing.org/reference/keyPressed.html), [keyReleased()](https://processing.org/reference/keyReleased_.html), [text()](https://processing.org/reference/text_.html), [image()](https://processing.org/reference/image_.html), [SoundFile](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/SoundFile.html), and [play()](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/SoundFile_play_.html). I also referred to some coding forums on [using state variables](https://discourse.processing.org/t/changing-game-states-beginner/16526/2) and on [using booleans in if statements for java](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24743366/the-operator-is-undefined-for-the-argument-types-boolean-int). I took the sound file of the page flipping from a [sound effects page](https://www.soundjay.com/page-flip-sounds-1.html#google_vignette) from which I chose the one I liked best. Lastly, my biggest source of information was the class discord channel as well as lecture recordings and in-class time where I was able to ask for help with my code.
